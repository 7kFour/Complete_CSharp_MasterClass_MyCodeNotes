INHERITANCE CHALLENGE 

Expand on the code from Inheritance_Introduction_Pt2 by adding a deriving Class "VideoPost"
with properties VideoURL and Length. 

Create the required constructors to create a VideoPost 
Adjust the ToString() method accordingly 
Create an instance of VideoPost and use the ToSTring method on it 

ADVANCED CHALLENGE 

Hint: Use Timer and Callback 
Add fields and methods as required to "VideoPost" Class

Add member method "Play" which should write the current duration of the video
Add a "Stop" method which should stop the "timer" and write "Stopped at {theTimerValue}" onto the console
"play" the video when the object is instantiated and stop it when the user presses any key 

Keep it simple with the key press.
Video playback is really just starting and stopping a timer.
